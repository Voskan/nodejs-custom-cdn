# Node.js Custom CDN

This repository contains the source code for the Node.js Custom CDN tutorial, demonstrating how to build a high-performance custom Content Delivery Network (CDN) with Node.js from scratch. The tutorial covers various essential aspects such as understanding CDNs, setting up your development environment, designing the architecture, and implementing the server using Node.js and Express. It also delves into advanced features like caching, load balancing, security, monitoring, logging, and performance optimizations.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
 * `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nodejs-custom-cdn.git`

2. Change to the project directory:
 * `cd nodejs-custom-cdn`

3. Install the required dependencies:
 * `npm install`

4. Copy the `.env.example` file to create an `.env` file and configure it with your settings:
 * `cp .env.example .env`

5. Add your SSL certificates to the `ssl` directory.

6. Start the server:
 * `node app.js`

Your custom CDN server will be up and running, serving static files from the `public` directory with caching, compression, logging, and monitoring.
